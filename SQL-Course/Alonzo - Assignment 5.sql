-- 1. The hostname in my SQL shows the server location of each user. 
-- 2. The '%' leaves the host name unrestricted, % is a wildcard placeholder usually. 
-- 3. The principle of least privilege is the compartmentalization of access to data in order to prevent unauthorized or unwitting slippage of information. 
-- 4. The risk of giving the DROP command has the possibility of a user unknowingly deleting important information. 
-- 5. The GRANT privilege gives a user the power to alter user privileges and access for all users within the specified system.
