/*If anyone wants a good exercise, take this array and output strings to the console, one at a time with each name as a separate HTML paragraph using a JavaScript for-loop:
 
const names = ["Tim", "Tom", "Mike"];
 
e.g. output in the console would look like:
<p>Tim</p>
<p>Tom</p>
<p>Mike</p>
 
You can use our memorized for-loop, or a for-of loop would also work well for this.
