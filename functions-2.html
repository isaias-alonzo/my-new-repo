//Objective: To reinforce the concepts of higher-order functions in JavaScript programming language.


Setup: Create a new HTML file in VS Code and name the file "functions-2.html". The file should have only a default HTML structure. Title the webpage "JavaScript Functions Assignment 2".


Instructions: Within the body, create a <script> tag and write JavaScript code to do the following:

1. Define a function called "double" that takes a single numeric parameter, "num", and returns its double.
2. Define a function called "triple" that takes a single numeric parameter, "num", and returns its triple.
3. Define a function called "apply" that takes two parameters:
"func" - a function
The apply function should call the function passed into "func", using "num" as an argument and then return the result.
4. Call the "apply" function with a number and the "double" function as arguments, and output the result to the console.
5. Call the "apply" function with a number and the "triple" function as arguments, and output the result to the console.
6. Verify that your code works by running it and checking the output in either VS Code or in your web browser's developer console.


Submission: For submission, you can either attach your .html file, or you can paste your code *as plain text* into the comment box. If you are pasting, please be careful not to leave any code out. //
